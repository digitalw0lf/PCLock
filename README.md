= PCLock

Simple screen locking utility that blocks all input but still allows you to see what's running on the screen.

This is not a secure protection against a qualified user! Only a basic protection against some cats jumping on keyboard, kids playing with mouse etc.

Unlock PIN code can be specified in command line (e.g. in desktop shortcut properties). Default is "unlock".
